# Important: Files to Upload

Some files couldn't be pushed automatically to GitHub due to API size limitations. Please manually upload these files to complete the repository:

1. `src/content.js` - This is the main content script that handles text analysis and UI rendering
2. `assets/icon16.png` - 16x16 extension icon

4. `assets/icon128.png` - 128x128 extension icon

You can download these files from your local copy of the extension and upload them directly through the GitHub web interface.
