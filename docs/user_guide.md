# TextTally User Guide

## Getting Started

TextTally is a browser extension that helps you analyze text with just a few clicks. This guide will walk you through how to use TextTally and understand its features.

## How to Use TextTally

### Basic Usage

2. **Right-Click**: Right-click on the highlighted text.
3. **Choose TextTally**: Click on "Analyze with TextTally" from the context menu.

### Understanding Your Results

The TextTally popup provides several sections of information:

#### Basic Counts

- **Words**: The total number of words in your selected text.
- **Characters (no spaces)**: The number of characters excluding spaces.
- **Characters (with spaces)**: The total number of characters including spaces.
- **Min read time**: Estimated reading time based on an average reading speed of 200 words per minute.

#### Readability

TextTally uses the Flesch-Kincaid readability formula to assess how easy your text is to read:

- **Grade 5 (Very Easy)**: Score 90-100. Simple, conversational English that 5th graders can understand.
- **Grade 6 (Easy)**: Score 80-89. Easily understood by 6th graders.
- **Grade 7 (Fairly Easy)**: Score 70-79. Fairly easy to read.
- **Grade 8-9 (Standard)**: Score 60-69. Plain English. Easily understood by 13-15 year olds.
- **Grade 10-12 (Fairly Difficult)**: Score 50-59. Fairly difficult to read.
- **College (Difficult)**: Score 30-49. Difficult to read, best understood by college students.
- **College Graduate (Very Difficult)**: Score 0-29. Very difficult to read, best understood by university graduates.

The progress bar visually represents where your text falls on this scale.

#### Long Sentence Alert

If your text contains sentences with more than 25 words, TextTally will flag them as potentially too long. Long sentences can be harder to read and understand.

#### Keyword Cloud

The keyword cloud shows your most frequently used words (excluding common words like "the," "and," etc.). This can help you identify:

- Overused words that you might want to vary
- Key themes in your writing
- Words that might need to be replaced with more precise alternatives

## Tips for Better Writing

Based on TextTally's analysis, here are some ways to improve your writing:

1. **Aim for a readability score of 60-70** for general audiences.
2. **Keep most sentences under 25 words** for better clarity.
3. **Vary your vocabulary** if you see the same words appearing frequently in your keyword cloud.
4. **Consider your audience** when interpreting the readability score. Technical or academic writing may naturally have a lower score.

## Privacy

TextTally respects your privacy:
- All analysis happens locally in your browser
- Your text is never sent to any server
- No data collection or tracking
